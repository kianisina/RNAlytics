# BioRNAlytics

BioRNAlytics is a web-based bioinformatics platform designed to simplify RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis for researchers and biologists. The platform allows users to upload gene expression count matrices, perform statistical analysis, visualize results, and download processed data without requiring advanced programming knowledge.

## Features

-  **Differential Gene Expression Analysis**
    - Upload RNA-seq count data
    - Compare experimental groups
    - Identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
    - Calculate log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values

-  **Interactive Visualizations**
    - PCA plot
    - Volcano plots for DEG overview
    - Heatmaps for expression patterns
    - Visualization of upregulated and downregulated genes

-  **Data Export**
    - Download processed expression results as CSV files
    - Export DEG tables for downstream analysis

-  **User-Friendly Interface**
    - Designed for researchers without extensive bioinformatics programming experience
    - Streamlined workflow from raw count matrix to biological interpretation

## Workflow

1. Upload RNA-seq count matrix as .txt or csv
2. Define experimental conditions/groups
3. Run differential expression analysis
4. Explore results using:
   - PCA plot
   - Volcano plots
   - Heatmaps
   - DEG tables
5. Download results for further analysis
